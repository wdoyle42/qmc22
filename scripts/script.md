## The problem

Hidden data, hidden models generate policy decisions

## The solution

Simulated data that replicates to the extent possible the characteristics of the data under consideration

Modeling processes that match what's used in the field-- that can then be shown to a non-technical audience

Allow the audience to change policy decisions based on information to show implications for equity
